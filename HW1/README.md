# Linear Regression

This repository contains code for optimizing a single-variable regression model using the least-squares and gradient descent algorithms. Additionally, there is code to evaluate the coefficient of determination and many helper functions to create, and load synthetic and real data. 

There is a notebook that explores linear regression in the single and multivariate case as well as polynomial data transforms to fit nonlinear data. 


## Usage

First activate a new environment with `poetry shell`. Then, install the project dependencies using `poetry install`. Finally, start your jupyter server using `poetry run jupyter notebook`.

You should now be able to go through the notebook titled `EEC189_HW1.ipynb`.
